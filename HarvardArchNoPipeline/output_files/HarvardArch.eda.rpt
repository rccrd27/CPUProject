Info (119006): Selected device 5CGXFC7C7F23C8 for design "HarvardArch"
Warning (18550): Found RAM instances implemented as ROM because the write logic is disabled. One instance is listed below as an example.
    Info (119043): Atom "prog_mem:inst|altsyncram:altsyncram_component|altsyncram_i1o1:auto_generated|ram_block1a12" is instantiated as RAM, but it is actually implemented as ROM function because the write logic is always disabled
Warning (18236): Number of processors has not been specified which may cause overloading on shared machines.  Set the global assignment NUM_PARALLEL_PROCESSORS in your QSF to an appropriate value for best performance.
